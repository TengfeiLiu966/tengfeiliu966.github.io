<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a lecturer at Beijing University of Technology. Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree from Beijing University of Technology in June 2025, where I was supervised by Prof. [Yongli Hu](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37420507000) (胡永利). From February 2024 to February 2025, I was a visiting student at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), working under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaojun Chang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085779024)([常晓军](https://www.xiaojun.ai/)) and Prof. [Hanyu Gu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Hanyu.Gu).

My research interests include Multimodal LLM, Radiology Report Generation, Long Document Understanding, Zero-shot Learning, Multimodal Representation, etc.

# Students (with post-graduation position)
<span class='anchor' id='-students'></span>

## Messages for applying students
- I am looking for ***self-motivated and team-worked*** students to work on the following topics: 
  - **LoRA and Mixture of Experts**
  - **Graph-based recommendation and data mining**
  - **Graph-based social network analysis**
  - **Graph-based brain activity analysis for medical use**
- However, I received a lot of applications, and I am sorry that I cannot reply to all of them. Thus, I will set a priority queue to whom ***really cares aboout*** his/her application. To be specific, the applicant who place the number ```$709394``` ahead of the application email title will be given the priority of consideration.
- 我们欢迎对图神经网络、推荐系统、基础模型微调、脑科学等领域感兴趣，且有着自律与团队意识的同学加入。遗憾的是，我们每次会收到大量的申请，无法一一回复。因此，为了照顾真正想来而非刷楼的申请，我们将优先考虑在申请邮件标题前面添加了字符```$709394```的同学（例如：$709394-研究生申请-张三-克莱登大学）。
